# SPYOU-NetApp

## Project Description
There is an increase in violation of community guidelines due to increased usage of hate speech, scurrility, and NSFW content. Such comments are difficult to spot, filter, and control manually, and not taking quick action would also defeat the goal of a harmonious and unified community.

We created a bot for Discord and Slack to detect any hate message or foul language which gets texted during a chat, to solve the above mentioned problem.
This is an honest effort to filter what you see and guard your loved ones from the keyboard monsters.
